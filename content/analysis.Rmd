We describe here our detailed data analysis.

[second analysis page](/analysis2/)

## Motivation:

*Firstly, We want to know what factors affect and have relationships with the temperature. We want to test various variables such as “Year”, “Regions”, “CO2 emission”, “Coal”, “Gas”, “population”, “forest area”, and “Oil”. We are interested in answering whether those variables will lead to changes in the temperature and assume that these variables can affect or are related to temperature. We also want to compare these relationships and know which variable among those actually affects temperature most. Finally, we are wondering if our conclusions are valid and correct. 

```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(GGally)
library(patchwork) 
library(tmap)
library(sf)
library(spiralize)


source(
  here::here("static", "load_and_clean_data.R"),
  echo = FALSE)
```
## General Trend:

*In order to get the relationship between year and temperature, we firstly draw the figure of years and CO2emission. It is found that with the increase of years, co2 emission also increased. Then we have the plot and find that CO2emission is also directly proportional to the weather. Therefore, we can finally get: as the years increase, the co2 emissions increase, resulting in an increase in temperature which verify our one assumption.

```{r 1,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
World_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y=CO2emission,x=as.numeric(Year)))+geom_point()+
  labs(y="CO2 World emission")
(summary(lm(CO2emission~as.numeric(Year),data=World_data)))

World_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=CO2emission,y=temperature))+geom_point()+
  labs(x="CO2 World emission",y="Global temp anormaly")+geom_smooth()
(summary(lm(temperature~CO2emission,data=World_data)))
```

## Visualization:
*Secondly, we get the map that shows the degree of temperature change in each region over a fixed period of time. But all we know from this map is that the magnitude of the temperature change is different for each region. We do not know what internal changes are causing the temperature to change more. Maybe it's because of changes in the terrain or just because of the geography. We have no way of knowing and this is one limitation of our anaylsis.From this data, we can also plot the average change in temperature from year to year. As we can see, the images still appear to be positively proportional, which again confirms our inferences about the relationship between year and temperature.



## Modeling:

*Then, we draw a correlation matrix to see the correlation between each parameters. From the plot we find that all the parameter is highly correlated with the temperature. We let temperature always be the Y-axis, and the variables "CO2 emission", "Coal", "Gas", "population", "forest area" and "Oil" are used as the X-axis respectively. We get the conclusion that the relationship between forest area and temperature is negative. For other variables, the greater the quantity, the higher the temperature. And we find that when only test one specific parameters. All the parameter is significant when testing the linear model.However, there seems to be a problem that these parameter are highly correlated with each other, the problem of multicollinearity may appear in our model when add all the parameter in the linear model.Then we run a model with all the parameter add together. The result shows that only the parameter coal is significant. However the result indicate that add all parameter together is not a good choice. We then use the backward step wise AIC to do the model selection. The result is the parameter coal and CO2emission is significant when predicting the temperature. And our final model is temperature ~ Coal + CO2emission, the p-value of this model is small enough and the R^2 is 0.8259, which illustrate that our model can represent most of the data.

summary(mult_lm)

step(mult_lm, direction = 'both')
final_mod = lm(temperature ~ Coal + CO2emission)
summary(final_mod)
```

## Conclusion:

*Finally, we validate our results through two ways. One of them checks for Normality by drawing the relationship between 'Theroretical Quantiles' and 'Sample Quantiles'. From the plot we can find that although most of the point seems follow the line, however some points in the middle part has it's own trend, which means our model is not quite good enough. Secondly, the relationship between fitted values and standardized residuals is plotted to check for Constant Variance. It is obvious that the residual is not normally distributed since in the right lower corner there is a empty space. This may happen because there might be some multicollinearity happens between the amount usage of coal and CO2emission. However this is our limit, since most of the data that we collect such as "population", "deforestation", the use of "fossil fuel" more or less has some correlation with the CO2emission, and the CO2emission is the major cause of the climate change. Our conclusion is that CO2emission contributes a lot to the climate change. 


```{r checking,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
y_hat = final_mod$fitted.values
diagnostics = lm.influence(final_mod)
hat = diagnostics$hat
sigmasq_hat = sum(final_mod$residuals ^ 2) / final_mod$df.residual
std_res = final_mod$residuals / sqrt(sigmasq_hat * (1 - hat))
diag <- tibble(y_hat, std_res)

diag %>% ggplot(aes(sample = std_res)) +
  geom_qq() + geom_qq_line() +
  labs(x = 'Theroretical Quantiles', y = 'Sample Quantiles',
       title = 'Checking for Normality')

diag %>% ggplot(aes(y_hat, std_res)) +
  geom_point() + geom_hline(yintercept = c(-2, 2), color = 'blue') +
  labs(x = 'fitted values', y = 'standardized residuals',
       title = 'Checking for Constant Variance')
```
