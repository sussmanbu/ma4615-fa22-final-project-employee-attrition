This comes from the file `content/analysis.Rmd`.

We describe here our detailed data analysis.


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(GGally)
library(patchwork)
print(getwd())
data <- read_csv(here::here("dataset/loan_refusal_clean.csv"))
load(here::here("dataset/loan_refusal.RData"))
print(ls())
```

```{r}
CO2_clean_1 %>% ggplot(aes(y=World,x=Year))+geom_point()+labs(y="CO2 World emission")
(summary(lm(World~Year,data=CO2_clean_1)))

CO2_temp %>% ggplot(aes(x=World,y=Mean))+geom_point()+labs(x="CO2 World emission",y="Global temp anormaly")
(summary(lm(World~Mean,data=CO2_temp)))



```

```{r year-variables}
p1 = World_data %>% ggplot(aes(as.numeric(Year),temperature)) + geom_line() +
  labs(x = 'year', y = 'temperature', title = 'The trend of temperature')

p2 = World_data %>% ggplot(aes(as.numeric(Year),`forest area`)) + geom_line() +
  labs(x = 'year', y = 'forest area', title = 'The trend of forest area')

p3 = World_data %>% ggplot(aes(as.numeric(Year),population)) + geom_line() +
  labs(x = 'year', y = 'population', title = 'The trend of population')

p4 = World_data %>% ggplot(aes(as.numeric(Year),Gas)) + geom_line() +
  labs(x = 'year', y = 'Gas', title = 'Gas trend')

p5 = World_data %>% ggplot(aes(as.numeric(Year),Oil)) + geom_line() +
  labs(x = 'year', y = 'Oil', title = 'Oil trend')

p6 = World_data %>% ggplot(aes(as.numeric(Year),Coal)) + geom_line() +
  labs(x = 'year', y = 'Coal', title = 'Coal trend')

p7 = World_data %>% ggplot(aes(as.numeric(Year),CO2emission)) + geom_line() +
  labs(x = 'year', y = 'CO2emission', title = 'CO2emission trend')

p1 / (p2|p3)
(p4|p5) / (p6|p7)
```

```{r mod}
attach(World_data)
World_data %>% select(-`Country Name`, -Year) %>%
  ggpairs(upper = list(continuous = wrap('points', alpha = .3, size = .1)),
          lower = list(continuous = wrap('cor', size = 4))) 

mlr1 = lm(temperature ~ `forest area` + World_data$population + Gas + Oil + Coal + CO2emission)
summary(mlr1)

mlr2 = lm(temperature ~ World_data$population + Gas + Oil + Coal + CO2emission)
summary(mlr2)

mlr3 = lm(temperature ~ World_data$population + Gas + Coal + CO2emission)
summary(mlr3)

mlr4 = lm(temperature ~ World_data$population + Coal + CO2emission)
summary(mlr4)

mlr5 = lm(temperature ~ Coal + CO2emission)
summary(mlr5)

step(mlr, direction = 'both') #same with above

## Rubric: On this page

you will


* Introduce what motivates your Data Analysis (DA)
  * Which variables and relationships are you most interested in?
  * What questions are you interested in answering?
* Breadth of the DA
  * Make sure that you ask enough initial questions to explore the different variables in your data.
  * i.e. Do you explore more than just one or two variables? Do you explore a few different relationships or many?
* Depth of the DA
  * When you answer one question, usually more questions arise as well. 
  * The depth of the DA is about coming up with and exploring the answers to these questions, often iterating the process a few times.
* Modeling and Inference 
  * You should also include some kind of formal statistical model and/or inference. This could be a linear regression, logistic regression, hypothesis testing etc.
  * Explain the techniques you used for validating your results.
  * Describe the results of your modelling and make sure to give a sense of the uncertainty in your estimates and conclusions.
* Explain the flaws and limitations of your analysis
  * Are there some assumptions that you needed to make that might not hold? Is there other data that would help to answer your questions? ...
* Clarity Figures
  * Are your figures/tables/results easy to read, informative, without problems like overplotting, hard-to-read labels, etc?
  * Each figure should provide a key insight. Too many figures or other data summaries can detract from this.
* Clarity of Explanations
  * Do you introduce why you are doing each analysis?
  * How well do you explain each figure/result?
  * Do you provide interpretations that suggest further analysis or explanations for observed phenomenon?
* Organization and cleanliness.
  * Make sure to remove excessive warnings, use clean easy-to-read code, organize with sections or multiple pages, use bullets, etc.
  
  
**NOTE**: Your Data Analysis can be broken up into multiple pages if that helps with your organization.
