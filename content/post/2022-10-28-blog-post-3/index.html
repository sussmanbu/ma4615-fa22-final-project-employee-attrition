<p>In our data turnover.csv, we want to discuss the critical reasons employees leave the company. We have data from Edward Babushkin’s blog used to predict an Employee’s risk of quitting. The result is much more valuable to employers than the employees on whom the data is based. We may think more about the communities’ interests as the goal of this research project. Our data can also help employees know how to choose a company they are more likely to stay a long time before joining the company. There are variables like gender, age, and head_gender, which include some personally identifiable information (PII). To avoid data misuse, we need to follow the three principles: Beneficence, Respect for persons, and Justice. Thus we make sure we have the correct data for a good purpose.</p>
<p>Respect for persons:
For respect for persons principle, age, disability, or other circumstances, such as language or literacy, limit any of those three elements, people deserve special consideration and protection. Since our Employee Turnover dataset is a real dataset, and one of the variables in this data is age. Because this data shared from Edward Babushkin’s blog used to predict an Employee’s risk of quitting (with a Survival Analysis) The Model). I think the data were telling people in ways the purpose of the information collected about them. Also, people should know the potential risks because Edward Babushkin shared the data though a blog. However, we should consider more about data of age after we analysis this data and before we want to upload our data and research to the public environment. Because the element of age is what people want special protection. The principle of respect for persons may influence our data in this way.</p>
<p>Justice:
First, the significant reasons of employees leaving the company is what we want to find out. Also, the purpose of analysis is to help employers to retain the employees and help employees to choose a company which they are more likely to stay a long time, which means our data are relevant to improve their lives. Second, in the dataset, the variables like stag, gender, age, industry and so on are all essential elements for us, and thus we avoid undue burden. Moreover, we will post the research results and data on our website, so community members and other employers or employees could use our data and research results which are in a user-friendly form.</p>
<p>As we states above, there are some potential problems we might experience in our future study. For further analysis, We will handling on the data to minimize the amount of personally identifiable information to protect the privacy. Also we will try our best to focus on the processing and analysis part, carefully organize our languages and reduce unnecessary misunderstanding. Finally, after we make a proper analysis, we will post it back on the internet where we found the data. We believe that will have a positive affect on the community, the employer will find out a way to retain more employee, and the employee can know how likely they will continue work in a certain company.</p>
