<p>In our data turnover.csv, we want to discuss the critical reasons employees leave the company. We have data from Edward Babushkin’s blog used to predict an Employee’s risk of quitting. The result is much more valuable to employers than the employees on whom the data is based. We may think more about the communities’ interests as the goal of this research project. Our data can also help employees know how to choose a company they are more likely to stay a long time before joining the company. There are variables like gender, age, and head_gender, which include some personally identifiable information (PII). To avoid data misuse, we need to follow the three principles: Beneficence, Respect for persons, and Justice. Thus we make sure we have the correct data for a good purpose.</p>
<p>Justice:
First, the significant reasons of employees leaving the company is what we want to find out. Also, the purpose of analysis is to help employers to retain the employees and help employees to choose a company which they are more likely to stay a long time, which means our data are relevant to improve their lives. Second, in the dataset, the variables like stag, gender, age, industry and so on are all essential elements for us, and thus we avoid undue burden. Moreover, we will post the research results and data on our website, so community members and other employers or employees could use our data and research results which are in a user-friendly form.</p>
