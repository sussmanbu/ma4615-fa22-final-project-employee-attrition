<p>In our data turnover.csv, we want to discuss the critical reasons employees leave the company. We have data from Edward Babushkin’s blog used to predict an Employee’s risk of quitting. The result is much more valuable to employers than the employees on whom the data is based. We may think more about the communities’ interests as the goal of this research project. Our data can also help employees know how to choose a company they are more likely to stay a long time before joining the company. There are variables like gender, age, and head_gender, which include some personally identifiable information (PII). To avoid data misuse, we need to follow the three principles: Beneficence, Respect for persons, and Justice. Thus we make sure we have the correct data for a good purpose.</p>
