```{r}
library(tidyverse)

turnover_data <- read_csv(here::here("dataset", "turnover.csv"))

## CLEAN the data
turnover_data_clean <- turnover_data

write_csv(turnover_data_clean, file = here::here("dataset", "turnover.csv"))

save(turnover_data_clean, file = here::here("dataset/turnover.RData"))
```

```{r}
ggplot(turnover_data_clean, aes(x=age, y=stag, color = way)) + geom_point()+labs(y="experience")

```
From the plot we can the experience has a negative correlation with age, person with smaller age tend to have larger experience, also most of the employer take bus to work.

```{r}
turnover_lm <- lm(data=turnover_data_clean, stag~age)
summary(turnover_lm)
```
from the test statistic we can see that age is significant in this model since the p-value is smaller than 0.05.
