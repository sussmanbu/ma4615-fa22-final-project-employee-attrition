<p>We want to know what factors affect and have relationships with the temperature. We want to test various variables such as “Year”, “Regions”, “CO2 emission”, “Coal”, “Gas”, “population”, “forest area”, and “Oil”.
In order to get the relationship between year and temperature, we firstly draw the figure of years and CO2emission. It is found that with the increase of years, co2 emission also increased. Then we have the plot and find that CO2emission is also directly proportional to the weather. We then draw a correlation matrix to see the correlation between each parameters and temperature. Finally we use the backward step wise AIC to do the model selection, and test our model’s normality.</p>
