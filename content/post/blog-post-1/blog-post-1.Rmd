The columns of the data are about different types of information about each person, like Employee Name, Marital Status, Pay Rate, terminated, Position, Employment Status, Performance Score, EmpSatisfaction, DaysLateLast30, and so on. The row is different people. The HR Data was designed by Drs. Rich Huebner and Carla Patalano to accompany a case study designed for graduate HR students studying HR metrics, measurement, and analytics. I was able to load the data and clean those N/A data. We want to find the major reason that causes employee attrition. For example does salary, gender, age, or employee satisfaction plays an important role in attrition? The challenges are there are only 300 people in this data, and we are not sure whether it's enough to make a reasonable conclusion. Also, the column is too cluttered, we have to carefully work on filtering out which columns are useful for our analysis.
