title: MA 415 Final Project
draft: false

role: Climate Change
bio: This the data science project of Minghao Sun, Yuchen Wen, Yifei Cui, Yiling Qian and Marielle Belomme.Recycling aids in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by lowering energy consumption. The use of recycled materials in the manufacture of new products reduces the need for virgin materials. This reduces greenhouse gas emissions caused by the extraction or mining of virgin materials. Furthermore, manufacturing products from recycled materials uses less energy than manufacturing products from virgin materials. Waste reduction and wise shopping are even more effective at lowering greenhouse gas emissions caused by energy consumption. Less energy is required to extract, transport, and process materials to manufacture products when we buy less or reuse products. Buying products made from recycled materials, such as paper, plastic, and metal, rather than virgin materials, helps to reduce energy consumption. This is my data science project.
