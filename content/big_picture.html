<p>Recycling aids in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by lowering energy consumption. The use of recycled materials in the manufacture of new products reduces the need for virgin materials. This reduces greenhouse gas emissions caused by the extraction or mining of virgin materials. Furthermore, manufacturing products from recycled materials uses less energy than manufacturing products from virgin materials.</p>
<p>Waste reduction and wise shopping are even more effective at lowering greenhouse gas emissions caused by energy consumption. Less energy is required to extract, transport, and process materials to manufacture products when we buy less or reuse products. Buying products made from recycled materials, such as paper, plastic, and metal, rather than virgin materials, helps to reduce energy consumption.</p>
<p>You’ve probably heard that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases act like a blanket or cap, trapping some of the heat that the Earth would otherwise radiate into space. That’s the straightforward answer. But how do specific molecules trap heat? The answer there necessitates a dive into physics and chemistry.</p>
<p>When sunlight strikes the Earth’s surface, it absorbs some of the energy and reradiates it as infrared waves, which we perceive as heat. (Hold your hand over a dark rock on a warm sunny day to experience this phenomenon.) These infrared waves travel up into the atmosphere and, if unimpeded, will return to space.
Infrared waves in the atmosphere are not interfered with by oxygen or nitrogen. This is because molecules are picky about the wavelength range with which they interact, according to Smerdon. For example, oxygen and nitrogen absorb energy with tightly packed wavelengths of 200 nanometers or less, whereas infrared energy travels at wider and slower wavelengths ranging from 700 to 1,000,000 nanometers. Because those ranges do not overlap, oxygen and nitrogen treat infrared waves as if they do not exist; they allow the waves (and heat) to pass freely through the atmosphere.</p>
<p>It’s not the same with CO2 and other greenhouse gases. Carbon dioxide, for example, absorbs energy at a range of wavelengths ranging from 2,000 to 15,000 nanometers, which overlaps with infrared energy. CO2 vibrates and re-emits infrared energy in all directions as it absorbs this energy. Half of that energy is lost to space, and the other half is returned to Earth as heat, contributing to the ‘greenhouse effect.’</p>
<p>Here is the mean temperature chage of each country from 1961 to 2021.

Only from the color of the map, we see most countries have their temperature changed, and the region in easteren Europe has the most siginificant increase in temperature. The change in temperature can be assumed related to countries policies and their ecomomy type. In countries like Russia, Canada, and some Arabic countries, there economy are heavily based on their fossil resources, which will highly increase their CO2 emission.</p>

By the graph of the temperature, the global mean temperature change continously increase and at the year 2021, the mean temperature increased over 1 degree and we can predict in near future it will get over 1.5 degree. The trend of the increase of the global mean temperature is also follow the same trend as the increase of the CO2 during this period.</p>

In the CO2 emission graph, during these years, CO2 emission of each country increases. Combining CO2 emission graph and temperature change graph, the higher the CO2 emission is the higher the temperature increased. The United Kingdom kept an low emission rate during this 20 years and we can see the increase in temperature is also low and even in 2010, it temperature decreased. For countries like China, the increase in CO2 emission brings the increase in temperature. And now we need to build model to prove our hypothesis in the positive relation between CO2 emission and temperatur.</p>
<p>From our analysis, we found that CO2 emission and temperature change are highly correlated. We don’t have thousands of years to wait for nature to absorb the CO2 flood. By then, billions of people would have suffered and died as a result of the effects of climate change; mass extinctions would have occurred, and our beautiful planet would be unrecognizable. Much of the damage and suffering can be avoided by decarbonizing our energy supply, removing CO2 from the atmosphere, and developing more sustainable ways of thriving.
